    <h2>Welcome to React Finance</h2>
    <p>
      A web application where users can buy and sell stock (no real money
      required). Please pardon the initial load time, the back-end server hosted
      for free on Heroku has to be woken up after an extended period without
      receiving traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app was built using Full-Stack JavaScript (Node, Express, MongoDB,
      and React) as a personal project to become more familiar with the modern
      React front-end ecosystem. See footer below for links to source code.
    </p>
